# DynamicSpectralClustering
Matlab implementation of online and offline dynamic spectral clustering as described in [1]. Under demo folder, simulation 1 of the paper is implemented and it shows how to use the codes to detect dynamic community structures. Further details can be found by `help dsc_online` or `help dsc_offline`.
